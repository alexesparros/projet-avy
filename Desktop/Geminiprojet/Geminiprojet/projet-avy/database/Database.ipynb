Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!<br><br><strong>Features </strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm!  </strong> Raise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more!

Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community.  As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.<br><br></li><li><strong>Improve your skills over time. </strong> As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging.

Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star. <br><br></li><li><strong>Explore a vast, mysterious cave. </strong> As you travel deeper underground, you'll encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments, valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and mysteries to be uncovered. <br><br></li><li><strong>Breathe new life into the valley.</strong> Since JojaMart opened, the old way of life in Stardew Valley has changed.

         "Set in the zombie apocalypse, Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning Left 4 Dead, the #1 co-op game of 2008.  This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns. <br><br>You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.<br><br>Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance. L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played, custom-fitted to your style of play.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Next generation co-op action gaming from the makers of Half-Life, Portal, Team Fortress and Counter-Strike.<br></li><li>Over 20 new weapons &amp; items headlined by over 10 melee weapons – axe, chainsaw, frying pan, baseball bat – allow you to get up close with the zombies<br></li><li>New survivors. New Story. New dialogue. <br></li><li>Five expansive campaigns for co-operative, Versus and Survival game modes.<br></li><li>An all new multiplayer mode.<br></li><li>Uncommon common infected. Each of the five new campaigns contains at least one new uncommon common zombies which are exclusive to that campaign. <br></li><li>AI Director 2.0: Advanced technology dubbed The AI Director drove L4D's unique gameplay – customizing enemy population, effects, and music, based upon the players’ performance.

Every choice you make drives your story forward, each decision leaving your mark on the world. Define your legacy, nurture relationships and create enemies, and solve problems your way. No two playthroughs will ever be the same.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/01_Bullets_points.png?t=1748346026\" /></div><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">allows you to combine your forces in combat and simultaneously attack enemies, or split your party to each follow your own quests and agendas.

What becomes of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure. </ul> <br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/06_Bullets_points_Customise.png?t=1748346026\" /></div> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">so that when you hit ‘go live’, your stream isn’t interrupted by a bear, swear, or lack of underwear.

DayZ includes the original Chernarus terrain, and the Livonia terrain.<br><br>Chernarus – The iconic DayZ terrain, set in the post-soviet state of Chernarus and encompassing 230 km2 of hand-crafted environment based on real life locations.<br><br>Livonia – The dense 163 km2 map lets players experience the hardcore survival hit in a whole new environment. Players can put their survival skills to the test by venturing into the unfamiliar land of Livonia, and seeing just how long they can last in this deadlier-than-ever world.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/infectedv2.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet Others</h2><br>Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/meetothers.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive Chernarus</h2><br>The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/survive+navigation_v2.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot Up</h2><br>Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/contaminated.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take your Shot</h2><br>Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/takeyourshotv2.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Install Mods</h2><br>Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like-minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan-made features, maps, and guns – all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/basebuilding+crafting.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enter Livonia</h2><br>Teeming with wildlife, ruins, and hidden locations, Livonia offers 163 km2 of fields, forests, and mysterious landscape – a unique new experience that will appeal to newcomers and DayZ veterans alike.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/enterlivonia.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore the Land</h2><br>An exciting variety of undiscovered locations awaits the brave and adventurous. Explore murky swamps, abandoned hunting cabins, sawmills and deforested areas, as well as massive quarries containing stashes of leftover explosives. <br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/explore.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Follow the bear</h2><br>Livonia’s food supply is scarce. If you want to survive, you’ll have to learn how to hunt, fish, and forage in the unforgiving wilderness. Luckily, the land appears to be more alive now than it ever was before the apocalypse.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/bear.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Discover the secret</h2> <br>Venture south and find the hidden entrance that leads to a mysterious underground complex. Make sure you’re with a friend while you look for a way in. And don’t forget to bring some supplies, especially a flashlight. Otherwise you might get lost in the darkened maze of corridors awaiting all who enter.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/221100/extras/Bunker.gif?t=1748433585\" /></div>",
