"Fight in the theatre of war that changed the world forever. Battle alongside your compatriots on some of the most inhospitable environments of the Eastern Front in Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45.

You can play as infantry, using a wide range of infantry weapons, or crew one of the many armored combat vehicles available in the game, from half-tracks to the most famous German and Soviet heavy tanks. Engage the enemy with everything in your arsenal, from your bayonet at close quarters up to the massive 122mm cannon on the Soviet IS-2.

As with the original Peggle, Peggle Extreme requires players to fire a metallic silver ball from the top of the screen, relying on gravity to propel the ball downwards while ricocheting off orange and blue &quot;pegs&quot;. The goal is to clear all the orange pegs from the screen before running out of balls. A moving &quot;bucket&quot; at the bottom of the screen offers free balls, while green power-up and purple &quot;bonus multiplier&quot; pegs provide additional twists. Peggle Extreme features one power-up in the form of Bjorn the Unicorn, whose special takes the form of a &quot;super-guide&quot; sighting capability which enables players to see where there next shot will go beyond one or two initial bounces.<br><br>					<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Master 10 levels of &quot;Extreme&quot; challenges<br>					</li><li>Conquer 5 Master challenges<br>					</li><li>Play against a friend or the computer in Duel Mode<br>					</li><li>Revel in breathtaking artwork and sounds from Half-Life: Episode 2, Portal, and Team Fortress 2<br>					</li><li>Replay and save your best shots</li></ul>","[""PopCap Games, Inc.""]",,"[{""id"": ""4"", ""description"": ""Casual""}, {""id"": ""37"", ""description"": ""Free To Play""}]",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/header.jpg?t=1702414944,True,,[],[],,,Peggle Extreme,[],,"{""minimum"": ""<strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong> Windows 2000/XP/Vista, 256 MB RAM, 700MHz or faster, DirectX: 7.0""}","{""windows"": true, ""mac"": false, ""linux"": false}",,"[""Electronic Arts""]","{""esrb"": {""rating"": ""t"", ""descriptors"": ""Mild Blood\r\n\r\nViolent References""}}",,"{""coming_soon"": false, ""date"": ""11 Sep, 2007""}",0,,"[{""id"": 0, ""path_thumbnail"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002653.600x338.jpg?t=1702414944"", ""path_full"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002653.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702414944""}, {""id"": 1, ""path_thumbnail"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/ss_2ba3ab7ee841e70ed2e13b569a4cbe0f45ca20bb.600x338.jpg?t=1702414944"", ""path_full"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/ss_2ba3ab7ee841e70ed2e13b569a4cbe0f45ca20bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702414944""}, {""id"": 2, ""path_thumbnail"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002654.600x338.jpg?t=1702414944"", ""path_full"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002654.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702414944""}, {""id"": 3, ""path_thumbnail"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002655.600x338.jpg?t=1702414944"", ""path_full"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002655.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702414944""}, {""id"": 4, ""path_thumbnail"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002656.600x338.jpg?t=1702414944"", ""path_full"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002656.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702414944""}, {""id"": 5, ""path_thumbnail"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002657.600x338.jpg?t=1702414944"", ""path_full"": ""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3483/0000002657.1920x1080.jpg?t=1702414944""}]","Peggle Extreme delivers fast-paced puzzle action that combines elements of pinball and pachinko to create a truly unique game experience.

"Let the battle begin! The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe add-on continues the renowned Cossacks II:Napoleonic Wars game. It depicts the rather short historic period of the Napoleonic wars. The Napoleon wars changed Europe forever, leading to the formation of empires and putting an end to almost one thousand years of constant strife between small states. The game provides mass-scale battles between thousands-strong armies of the nations involved in conflicts during this period. The theatres of operation introduce France, Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Egypt, and three nations not represented in the original game – Spain, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (Poland), and the Confederation of the Rhine.<br>						The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe reconstructs in detail the soldiers' uniforms weapons and architecture of each nation. Each nation's army has its unique units and possibilities. The game includes over 180 units 190 buildings and 1200 flora and fauna elements. When developing the combat system the peculiarities of early 19th century warring were taken into account as was the value of formations provisions and troop morale. Tactical tricks utilized by military commanders of the time are fully reflected in the game. An &quot;honest&quot; system of bullet and cannonball ballistics based on physics is an innovative addition to the Cossacks engine.
