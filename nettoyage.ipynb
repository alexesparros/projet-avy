Battle alongside your compatriots on some of the most inhospitable environments of the Eastern Front in Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. Red Orchestra places you in the most realistic WWII first-person multi-player combat to date on the PC, allowing the player to fight through some of the most intense combat of the war. You can play as infantry, using a wide range of infantry weapons, or crew one of the many armored combat vehicles available in the game, from half-tracks to the most famous German and Soviet heavy tanks. Engage the enemy with everything in your arsenal, from your bayonet at close quarters up to the massive 122mm cannon on the Soviet IS-2. And if that isn't enough, find an officer and a radio to call in thunderous artillery strikes to shake the enemy loose.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Crew 16 fully realized vehicles with highly detailed exterior and interior models <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Choose from 30 authentic infantry weapons <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Full 50+ player online Multiplayer Support<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Unique Setting - the only FPS to focus on the WWII Russian Front<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Engage enemy tanks at 800 metres and more with the Simulation-level armored vehicle combat<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Fight the full range of combined arms infantry and vehicle combat in detailed environments based on real-world data, from city-centre to deeply rural settings <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Realistic bullet and projectile ballistics will make you duck for cover <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Coordinate strategies with your team-mates via Voice Over IP <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Authentic Immersive Sound FX and 3d Positional Sound System <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>3D 'Iron Sights' and unique 3D scope system <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>True weapon deployment system including resting rifles on support<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Historically accurate artillery system <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Distance-based sound system dynamically creates the battle ambiance<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Advanced player movement system featuring diving over obstacles and leaning <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Custom 8 way animation system for highly realistic player animations </li></ul>New for Summer '07<br>\t\t\t\t\tThis update includes a new map, a new vehicle and some major graphical enhancements to the game and is available to owners of the game for free through Steam.

Battle alongside your compatriots on some of the most inhospitable environments of the Eastern Front in Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. Red Orchestra places you in the most realistic WWII first-person multi-player combat to date on the PC, allowing the player to fight through some of the most intense combat of the war. You can play as infantry, using a wide range of infantry weapons, or crew one of the many armored combat vehicles available in the game, from half-tracks to the most famous German and Soviet heavy tanks. Engage the enemy with everything in your arsenal, from your bayonet at close quarters up to the massive 122mm cannon on the Soviet IS-2.

The law has failed to bring Elexis and her multi-billion dollar empire, SiNTEK, to justice, so Blade is determined to take matters into his own hands. Joining Blade on his mission are JC - a hacker with a secret to keep - and Jessica Cannon, a fiery rookie who can find her way into any secure facility.<br>\t\t\t\t\tEnter the living, breathing world of Freeport City, a futuristic collision of New York, San Francisco and Tokyo.

Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield, and even some environmental traps. It's certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming, but it's an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.”<br>7.4 – IGN<br>",

You can play as infantry, using a wide range of infantry weapons, or crew one of the many armored combat vehicles available in the game, from half-tracks to the most famous German and Soviet heavy tanks. Engage the enemy with everything in your arsenal, from your bayonet at close quarters up to the massive 122mm cannon on the Soviet IS-2.

Meanwhile the Clans, recovering from their near-destruction, begin to reunite their tribes.

Perhaps most pivotal to the conflict, however, is Mortis and her army of Undead Hordes. After all, the rebirth of her husband Gallean was her doing.

This beloved sequel to the groundbreaking DOOM (1993) introduced players to the brutal Super Shotgun, the infamous Icon of Sin boss, and more intense FPS action.<br><br><strong>TNT: Evilution  </strong><br>The UAC relocated their experiments to one of the moons of Jupiter. A spaceship, mistaken for a supply vessel, was granted access. But when it got close to the base, demons poured out. All your comrades were slaughtered or zombified. This time it's not about survival. It's about revenge.  <br><br><strong>The Plutonia Experiment</strong><br>Every effort has been made by the nation's top scientists to close the seven interdimensional Gates of Hell, but one portal remains open. Alone, you must infiltrate the ravaged base, defeat the demon Gatekeeper, and seal the last Hell portal before the undead take over the world.  <br><br><strong>Master Levels for DOOM II</strong><br>This expansion includes twenty additional levels, all with the same hell-spawned horrors and action of the base game. Each level was created by independent designers and supervised by id Software.<br><br><strong>Sigil</strong><br>Created by id Software co-founder, John Romero, and released as an episode-sized mod consisting of 18 new maps, Sigil fits in between the timelines of DOOM (1993) and DOOM II.  Baphomet, the gatekeeper of Hell, “glitched the final teleporter with his hidden sigil, whose eldritch power brings you to even darker shores of Hell. You fight through this stygian pocket of evil to confront the ultimate harbingers of Satan, then finally return to become Earth’s savior.”<br><br><strong>Legacy of Rust</strong><br>Created in collaboration by id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames, Legacy of Rust is the newest episode for DOOM, and the first official episode since DOOM II to feature new demons and weapons.
